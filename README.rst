If you want to use an unofficial version of the ``itunes-last-export`` application, you need to work from a
clone of this ``git`` repository.

- clone from github ::

   $ git clone https://github.com/werdeil/itunes-last-export.git

- go in the cloned directory ::

   $ cd itunes-last-export

- start the application exactly in the same way as installed from pypi. All modifications performed
  in the cloned repository are taken into account when the application starts.

Until the pip package is available, you can start the tool by cloing the repository and then in the cloned directory::

	$ PYTHONPATH=. bin/itunes-last-export

The graphical interface shall start, you can then use it.
