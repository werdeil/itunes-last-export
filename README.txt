This tool allows you import playcounts from last.fm to update your iTunes database.

This tool is working on Mac and may work also on Windows but wasn't tested on this OS. For more information on how to use it, see the wiki section on its github page.

Feel free to give me any feedback, either on its github page: http://github.com/werdeil/itunes-last-export/
