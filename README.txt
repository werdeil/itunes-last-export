This tool allows you import playcounts from last.fm to update your iTunes database. It also update in the same time the last played date.

This tool is working on Mac and may work also on Windows but wasn't tested on this OS.

Feel free to give me any feedback on its github page: http://github.com/werdeil/itunes-last-export/
